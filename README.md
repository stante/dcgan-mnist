# dcgan-mnist
This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for MNIST.
It implements the suggested architectural constraints for stable learning from the paper
[Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)
by *Alec Radford, Luke Metz, Soumith Chintala*.

The generator and discriminator are all convolutional networks without max pooling but instead uses strided (and 
fractionally strided) convolutions. Fruthermore, batch normalization is used and ReLu and Leaky ReLU activations.
